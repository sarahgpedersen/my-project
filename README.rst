====================================
 CERN Student project - "math assignment rewritten"
====================================
The purpose of this student project at CERN is to rewrite an earlier project, but in a new format that is enduring and permanent. The idea is to be able to open, understand, and use this math project in 50 years with no qualms. The math project is taken from an assignment I was given in 2.g in gymnasium. The assignment is described directly in the code.
